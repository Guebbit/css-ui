# Guebbit SCSS Library

MIT License, free to use

This library plans to be a large container of very different SCSS components, 
divided using the [Atomic Design Methodology](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)  

The best approach is not import the whole library but carefully choose the components that we want from it.
